There are $N$ people numbered $1$ through $N$. Each person has a integer score called programming ability; person $i$'s programming ability is $P_i$ points. How many more points does person $1$ need, so that person $1$ becomes the strongest? In other words, what is the minimum non-negative integer $x$ such that $P_1 + x \gt P_i$ for all $i \neq 1$?

## **Constraints**
$1 \le N \le 100$
$1 \le Pi \le 100$
All input values are integers.

## **Input**
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
$N$
$P_1\ P_2\ P_3 \ldots P_N$

## **Output**
Print the answer as an integer.
